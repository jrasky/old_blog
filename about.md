      Hello!<br>
      <br>
      I'm a software developer. I currently attend the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada. I'm studying Computer Science, which is a continuation of the programming that I've been doing since about age eight.<br>
      <br>
      For three years during High School, I worked as a contractor at NASA Ames doing both backend and front-end website development. The specific experience I gained from that was with Django and backbone.js, with a smattering of other libraries thrown in. More recently, I've taken up Rust, and my focus has shifted to more systems-oriented programming.<br>
      <br>
      Check out my work on <a href="https://www.github.com/jrasky/">Github</a>, out take a look at my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resume.pdf">resume</a> for a more detailed explanation.
